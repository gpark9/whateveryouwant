'''
DISCO:
  - <br> instead of r"\n"
  - import individual functions from a python file

QCC:
0. Does any HTML work in the return window? Can you insert a HTML file there?

INVESTIGATIVE APPROACH:
1. Import csv
2. Follow the flask model (app.route("/"), app.run(), etc.)
3. Import our random occupations function from numbercruncher.py and run it
4. Open the occupations.csv file and turn its occupations into strings
5. Return one string contains all the inputs, separated by <br>
