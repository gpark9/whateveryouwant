DISCO
* Learned how to use json and parse content from a url into a json object
* Learned how to put in query into a url with the params parameter of requests.get
* Learned what %0A means in the context of a url --> represents a new line. Ran into an error where the txt file had a new line and that messed with our url.

QCC:
* Would it be better to have a python parameter for the key instead of a txt file?
