Bubbling-Phase: When the event's boolean argument is set to true,
it will be pushed to the front of the queue for the events that the html will be

Capturing-Phase: When the event's boolean argument is set to false, or the boolean
doesn't show up at all, the event will be placed at the back of the queue.
