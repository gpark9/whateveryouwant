K23 CSS Foundation Framework

* Mobile friendly: <meta name = "viewport" content = "width = device-width, initial-scale = 1">. Scales better and adjusts for mobile devices. Might be interesting/useful for later.
* Linking CDN (more fancy css that someone else coded) <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://dhbhdrzi4tiry.cloudfront.net/cdn/sites/foundation.min.css">
* another link (very basic and bare framework, nothing too fancy): https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/foundation-sites@6.7.5/dist/css/foundation.min.css" crossorigin="anonymous
* Different elements are pre-styled and have an aesthetic already. For example, the framework comes with a specific font and color scheme (different from if you were to use no CSS at all)
