      <h3>The Tale of Froggy and Kwak</h3>

    <div class="text-bg-success">
        Froggy, an adorable frog, saw Kwak, a majestic royal monkey sitting at the top of the palace. Froggy
        thought to themself, "wow, that's one furry monkey. I've never seen such glamorous fur before." Coming
        from the swamps, Froggy had only felt the slime and slickness of crocodiles. This changed everything, so Froggy jumped 
        up to the top of the palace, but miscalculated the jump. Froggy ended up on top of the roof, screaming for help
        from Kwak. Kwak, being the kind monkey he is, climbed up to the roof to rescue Froggy. The start of their love
        begins here.

    <!-- the documentation said this would only work with display:block or display:inline-block. we opted for the example with display:inline-block as we thought this would be more applicable to our work -->
        Stay tuned... To be continued...
    <!-- d-inline-block is the bootstrap shortcut to set display:inline-block. the style specifies where the text should be cut off. the ellipses are added automatically-->
