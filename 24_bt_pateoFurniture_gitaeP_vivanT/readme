q1: Bootstrap is preferred because it has a nicer aesthetic.

DISCO
    * Bootstrap has a more soft aesthetic compared to Foundation. Much more rounded edges for features like fonts, buttons, etc.

QCC
    * How do we make the pretty buttons actually work and do stuff?
    * The grid feature in our neighbor's tutorial changed unfavorably according to screen size, how can we make it more adaptable to different screen sizes?
